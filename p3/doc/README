README
This file contains a brief description of all the files created for this project.

design.pdf
This file is my design document which holds the information describing this entire project.
It explains why certain design decisions were made, how the code can be executed, and
an overall idea of what my code is trying to accomplish.

Makefile
This file allows the compilation of both the server and the client by "make udp-send"
and "make udp-recv". It also allows both to compile back to back with "make all".

udp-rcv.c
This file contains all the code that makes up the server and allows the server to run.
It runs the server code and allows the server to listen for an infinite time
waiting for clients to connect to it. It provides concurrency with forking.

udp-send.c
This file contains all the code that makes up the client and allows the client to run.
It has code which allows the client know which server(s) are up and exchange messages
with it. It contains pthreads to allow multithreading possible.

my1000kbFile.txt    my1500kbFile     my500kbFile     my200kbFile      my475kbFile     my42kbFile
These are test files that may be used to test the code that I have written. The amount of
bytes in each file is stated in the name of the file

"filename".out
This is the output file that will be created after running this program. You may compare
this file with the original file. It will be labeled as filename.out where filename is
the file you are looking for on the server(s).

client server
The names of the executables that are created when compiling the client and the server
